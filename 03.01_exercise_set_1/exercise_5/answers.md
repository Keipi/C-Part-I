Redirection sends the output stream of a program into a text file
It sends the contents of a file into a program

Piping sends the output stream of a program as the argument for the next program

In the first example, the file 'input' is streamed as argument for program and 
the output of the program is streamed into 'out'.

Ih the second example, the output of 'program' is the argument for the program 
'less'.
