The first three characters are `c0f`. This is because the last 12 bits contain:

1. 2 bits for the number 3
2. 5 bits for the number 0
3. 4 bits for the number 7
4. Last bit of the number 15

In binary, this will be: `1100 0000 1111`. The hex representation of `1100` is
c, then 0 for `0000` and f for `1111`.
