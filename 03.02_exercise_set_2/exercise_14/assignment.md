Purpose of this exercise: learn to apply a standard type in a non-standard way.

Design a program showing all combinations of all the program's command line arguments (not using the program name itself). Each combination should be displayed on a numbered line. The first line should be empty (none of the arguments are shown), the last one should show all the program's arguments.

Hints:

    this exercise is extremely simple: think about how values are stored in the bits of an integral-typed variable like an int.
    Localize as much as possible.
    Be aware of IRE!
    In case you're tempted: floating point values are nowhere necessary.
    A bit premature: to skip the program name do ++argv as 1st statement in main. 

Example:


    a.out if then else
    1: 
    2: if 
    3: then 
    4: if then 
    5: else 
    6: if else 
    7: then else 
    8: if then else
