Purpose of this exercise (letters): learn to determine sets of characters
(Extended) ascii characters fit in bytes (having 8 bits). In the header file ctype.h characters can be inspected for all kinds of characteristics (e.g., using functions like isspace to test whether a character is a space character) (cf. isspace(3)).

Not assuming anything about the ordering or position of letters in the ascii character set, fill a std::string with all letters found in the ascii character set.

Submit your program and the the program's output, showing the constructed string containing all letters.

Hint: letters consist of lowercase and uppercase characters, but a dedicated function is available testing whether a character is either a lowercase or an uppercase character.
