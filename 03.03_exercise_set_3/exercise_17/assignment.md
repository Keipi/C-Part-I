Purpose of this exercise: learn to define functions computing sums of values.

Define two overloaded functions sum returning the sum of the values of their arguments. One function computes the sum of integral values, the other function computes the sum of double values (not necessarily two values).

Illustrate your functions in main: if none of its command-line arguments contain a dot, then call the function summing integral values, otherwise call the function summing double values.

Note: both sum functions should receive argc and argv as their first two arguments. Don't first convert the argv NTBSs to either ints or doubles.
