Purpose of this exercise: create a program producing a multiplication table
Remember primary school? You had to learn by heart the multiplication tables. In this little program we're going to do that again, but differently.

Design a program that is called from the command-line with one argument: a numeric positive integral value for which the program should display the multiplication table.

You may assume that the argument that's passed to the program is indeed a positive integral value.

For example, starting the program as a.out 7 must produce:


    1 * 7 = 7
    2 * 7 = 14
    3 * 7 = 21
    4 * 7 = 28
    5 * 7 = 35
    6 * 7 = 42
    7 * 7 = 49
    8 * 7 = 56
    9 * 7 = 63
    10 * 7 = 70
    
Hints: make sure you localize. Also, avoid IREs.
